# Contributing Guide

## License

- LeafSpringCog operates under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/blob/base/LICENSE).

## General Guidelines

- Any and all contributions to this project should be made upstream to [LandSandBoat](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server) and should follow the guidelines & advice set forth by those developers. Pull requests in this repository will be ignored unless they pertain to bugs specific to LeafSpringCog.
- Players on Claybodin or other servers running on LeafSpringCog must maintain an active Final Fantasy XI service account via [Square Enix Account](https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/login?cont=account). Outdated game clients will not be able to connect to the server, and an active service account is required in order to maintain an up-to-date client.

## Donations

- I do not accept any monetary compensation on behalf of LeafSpringCog nor the Claybodin server for any reason, including but not limited to donations. Do not ask to nor attempt to send me money.
