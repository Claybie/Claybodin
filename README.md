## A (tiny) Final Fantasy XI Private Server

This repo hosts the code for my  private server I call Claybodin, which I keep online mostly for myself, but is open to the public. It is a fork of the LandSandBoat project base repository. There are small changes for building specifically on Gentoo Linux, as well as the following gameplay changes:

<ul>
    <li>Many Ciphers that are rewarded from Login Campaign points on retail have been changed to rewards from quests or missions that pertain to those characters. Roadmap is for all Trusts to be acquired via storyline method, rather than with currency, FoV, RoE etc. Claybodin does not run a Login Campaign. </li>
    <li>Weapon/Magic skillups have been removed from the game; characters are always at max skill for their level. I consider the system archaic and out-of-place for the current era.
    </li>
</ul>

There is little point in building the server from my repo unless you really want my gameplay changes and don't want to bother implementing them for yourself, and/or you are building on Gentoo like I am, which the developers do not officially support.
