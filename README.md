## A Final Fantasy XI Private Server

This repo is the source code for what the server I host runs on and is an almost 1:1 clone of the LandSandBoat project base repository, with some minor QoL & Trust acquisition changes, including:

<ul>
    <li>Many Ciphers that are rewarded from Login Campaign points on retail have been changed to rewards from quests or missions that pertain to them, with more planned.</li>
    <li>Battle Skillups have been removed from the game; characters are always at max skill for their level.
    </li>
</ul>



Visit the LandSandBoat [project page](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/) for more info. LandSandBoat is licensed under [GNU GPL v3](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/blob/base/LICENSE)

## How To Play

Connect to the server address claybodin.mywire.net using [Ashita](https://ashitaxi.com/) 

Improve the game's visuals with [XI-View](https://github.com/Caradog/XI-View) and [AshenbubsHD Texture Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy11/mods/1)

## Support

I expect to keep the server online 24/7 and synced with upstream daily. That said, I do not have the time or resources to provide user support of any kind, so temper your expectations before playing.
