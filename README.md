## A Final Fantasy XI Private Server Running On LandSandBoat

This repo hosts the code for the Claybodin private server. It is a fork of the LandSandBoat project base repository, with some minor customizations, including:

<ul>
    <li>Many Ciphers that are rewarded from Login Campaign points on retail have been changed to rewards from quests or missions that pertain to those characters. The goal is for all Trusts in the game to be acquired this way eventually. Claybodin does not run a Login Campaign. </li>
    <li>Weapon/Magic skillups have been removed from the game; characters are always at max skill for their level. I consider the system archaic and out-of-place for the current era of the game.
    </li>
</ul>

The goal of the project is to maintain and add gameplay deviations from retail that I consider improvements, while staying up-to-date with upstream.

Visit the LandSandBoat [project page](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/) for more info. LandSandBoat is licensed under [GNU GPL v3](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/blob/base/LICENSE).

## How To Play

Connect to the server address <b>claybodin.mywire.org</b> using [Ashita](https://ashitaxi.com/). 

Improve the game's visuals with [XI-View](https://github.com/Caradog/XI-View) and [AshenbubsHD Texture Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy11/mods/1).

Join the [FFXiPrivateServers](https://discord.gg/THnWnC9fjr) discord server for information on private servers, LandSandBoat development, client setup for Windows & Linux and more!

## Support

I expect to keep the server online 24/7 with very little downtime. That said, I do not have the time or resources to provide user support of any kind, so temper your expectations before playing.

## Server Hardware

Thinkpad W541 running Gentoo Linux
<ul>
    <li>Intel i7-4710MQ</li>
